# SeafloorVolcanism

Here is the original code added to StagYY for the Nature submission "No Magmatic Driving Force to Supply Seafloor Volcanism" by Green et al. for reviewer scrutiny.  A Code Availability statement will be forthcoming with more details.  Included is the raw code necessary to generate the dike results included in a related zenodo data archive. I do not own StagYY and do not have the rights to reproduce any code that has not been directly written by me.

Also included are the par files run by the models, so that input parameters can be examined.
